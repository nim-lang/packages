# Nim packages [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nim-lang/packages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nim-lang/packages)

This is a central listing of all packages for
[Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble), a package manager for the
[Nim programming language](http://nim-lang.org).

An overview of all the package is available at https://nimble.directory.

NOTE: The packages listed here are not peer-reviewed or otherwise screened. We try to keep the list up-to-date but we cannot guarantee quality or maturity of the packages.

## Adding your own package
To add your own package, fork this repository, edit
[packages.json](packages.json) and make a pull request.

[Packages.json](packages.json) is a simple array of objects. Each package
object should have the following fields (unless the field is marked as
optional):

  * name   - The name of the package, this should match the name in the package's
             nimble file.
  * url    - The url from which to retrieve the package.
  * method - The method that should be used to retrieve this package. Currently
             "git" and "hg" is supported.
  * tags   - A list of tags describing this package.
  * description - A description of this package.
  * license - The license of the source code in the package.
  * web    - An optional URL for humans to read additional information about
             the package.
  * doc    - An optional URL for humans to read the package HTML documentation

### Requirements

While we really appreciate your contribution, please follow the requirements: other developers will rely on your package. Non-compliant packages might be removed with no warning.

* The URL should work, a .nimble file should be present and the package should be installable
* The package should build correctly with the latest Nim release
* The package should not contain files without a license or in breach of 3rd parties licensing
* Non-mature packages should be flagged as such, especially if they perform security-critical tasks (e.g. encryption)
* If a vulnerability is found, make a patch release against the latest stable release (or more) that fixes the issue without introducing any other change.
* Tiny libraries should be avoided where possible
* Avoid having many dependencies. Use "when defined(...)" to enable optional features.
* If abandoning a package, please tag it as "abandoned"
* The package name should be unique and specific. Avoid overly generic names e.g. "math", "http"
* Provide a contact email address.
* Optionally try to support older Nim releases (6 months to 1 year)
* Optionally GPG-sign your releases
* Optionally follow [SemVer 2](http://semver.org)

Your packages may be removed if the url stops working. It goes without saying
that your pull request will not be accepted unless you fill out all of the
above required fields correctly, the package that ``url`` points to must also
contain a .nimble file, or else it will be rejected.

The requirements might change in future.

## Renaming packages

To rename a package you will need to add a new entry for your package. Simply
perform the following steps:

* Duplicate your package's current entry.
* Remove every field in one of the entries apart from the `name` field.
* Add an `alias` field to that entry.
* Change the name in the other package entry.

For example:

```
...
  {
    "name": "myoldname",
    "alias": "mynewname"
  },
  {
    "name": "mynewname",
    "url": "...",
    "method": "git",
    ...
  },
...
```
